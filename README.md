# carinsurance_pricing

This repository illustrates some work in using GLMs to price car
insurance based on car insurance policy and claim data. It also
features some systematic data exploration and the use of MonteCarlo
simulation to investigate the effectiveness of the pricing policies we
are using.

The data comes from the `CASdatasets` package that accompanies the
book "Computational Actuarial Science with R" edited by Arthur
Charpentier: http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466592599

The dataset is too large for CRAN so is available here:
